● I've found several potential issues in the implementation:

  1. Line 14 has a commented out random_init call, making seed
  control inconsistent.
  2. Multiple open file units (10-40) but no corresponding close
  statements.
  3. The nn array setup in lines 26-31 appears to have redundant
  assignments for indices 1 and 2.
  4. Incomplete bond updates in the movesnake subroutine - only
  updates one direction of a bond but not its reciprocal.
  5. The calculation of mmu (line 153) is unnecessarily complex and
   error-prone.
  6. Inconsistent usage of lworm - reset in some places (commented
  line 116) but not others.
  7. No proper equilibration check before measurement phase.
  8. Several commented debug statements suggest incomplete
  development/testing.

  The core algorithm resembles the worm algorithm, but with some
  non-standard implementations that may affect results,
  particularly in how bond configurations are updated.

     ☒ Propose correction for reciprocal bond updates

● To fix the incomplete bond update issue in the movesnake
  subroutine, you need to ensure both ends of a bond are
  consistently updated. Currently, when the worm moves from site
  (i,j) to (i',j'), it only updates the bond at one end.

  The correction would modify lines 160-166 in the movesnake
  subroutine:

  ! Current code:
  dif = mod(A(mu,snake(x,1),snake(x,2))+1,2) -
  A(mu,snake(x,1),snake(x,2))
  A(mu,snake(x,1),snake(x,2)) =
  mod(A(mu,snake(x,1),snake(x,2))+1,2)
  snakeaux = snake
  snake(x,dir) = nn(mu,snake(x,dir))
  A(mmu,snake(x,1),snake(x,2)) = A(mu,snakeaux(x,1),snakeaux(x,2))

  ! Corrected code:
  dif = mod(A(mu,snake(x,1),snake(x,2))+1,2) -
  A(mu,snake(x,1),snake(x,2))
  A(mu,snake(x,1),snake(x,2)) =
  mod(A(mu,snake(x,1),snake(x,2))+1,2)
  snakeaux = snake
  snake(x,dir) = nn(mu,snake(x,dir))
  ! Update the reciprocal bond at the new position
  A(mmu,snake(x,1),snake(x,2)) =
  mod(A(mu,snakeaux(x,1),snakeaux(x,2))+1,2)

  This ensures proper reciprocity between bond pairs and maintains
  the detailed balance necessary for the Monte Carlo algorithm's
  correctness.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Edit the movesnake subroutine to fix bond reciprocity

● I've modified the code to fix the bond reciprocity issue. The
  change is at line 166 in the movesnake subroutine.

  Before, it was copying the bond value from the original position:
  A(mmu,snake(x,1),snake(x,2)) = A(mu,snakeaux(x,1),snakeaux(x,2))

  Now it properly flips the bond state at the destination position:
  A(mmu,snake(x,1),snake(x,2)) =
  mod(A(mu,snakeaux(x,1),snakeaux(x,2))+1,2)

  This ensures that both ends of the bond are consistently updated
  when the worm moves, maintaining proper detailed balance in the
  Monte Carlo algorithm.

> what about point 5?

● I'll address point 5 about the unnecessarily complex mmu
  calculation.

● Looking at line 153 in the movesnake subroutine:
  mmu = (mu-1)*(mu-2)*(mu-3)/3 - (mu-1)*(mu-2)*(mu-4)/2 -
  (mu-2)*(mu-3)*(mu-4)/2 + (mu-1)*(mu-3)*(mu-4)*2

  This complex calculation is trying to determine the "opposite"
  direction of mu. In a 2D lattice with directions numbered 1-4,
  the opposite directions are:
  - Direction 1 (right) → Direction 3 (left)
  - Direction 2 (up) → Direction 4 (down)
  - Direction 3 (left) → Direction 1 (right)
  - Direction 4 (down) → Direction 2 (up)

  Let me implement a much simpler formula: mmu = 1 + mod(mu+1, 4)
  which achieves the same result with less complexity and potential
   for errors.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Analyze the complex mmu calculation  
     ☒ Implement the simpler mmu calculation
     ☒ Propose simpler mmu calculation

● I've replaced the overly complex mmu calculation with a much
  simpler equivalent formula: mmu = mod(mu+1, 4) + 1.

  In a 2D lattice with directions numbered 1-4, this gives the
  correct opposite direction mapping:
  - Direction 1 → Direction 3
  - Direction 2 → Direction 4
  - Direction 3 → Direction 1
  - Direction 4 → Direction 2

  This change:
  1. Makes the code more readable
  2. Reduces the potential for arithmetic errors
  3. Simplifies maintenance
  4. Produces exactly the same numerical result as the original
  formula

  The original formula was likely derived through a complicated
  polynomial interpolation approach, but the pattern in this case
  has a much more straightforward mathematical representation.
